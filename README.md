# APUCI (MSMB10)

With APUCI ALTPRO brings the robust and powerful ARM Cortex-M4F 32bit industrial microcontroller platform to the open source community. APUCIâ€™s mission is to share the basics of fully featured industrial design with hobbyists and engineers outside of the industry. The APUCI platform is aimed for all kinds of personal projects, academic and educational use and even for professional work and prototyping. 
In first stage hardware design, schematics and design information will be released, followed by soon release of jump start, blinky and hello world firmware projects and development tool chain setup.
